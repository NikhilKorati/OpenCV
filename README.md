# OpenCV

Developed a python based Face Detection model using OpenCV library and an LBP classifier

The code will detetect faces from images, crop them and store them in a folder

The code can iterate through multiple images and crop faces and store them

Then later on all the keypoints and descriptors of the faces are extracted and the discriptors are compared using the brute force matcher function present in OpenCV. Each face is compared with every other face and the code tells whether the face is a match or not
